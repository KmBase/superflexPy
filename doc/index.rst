=======================================
SuperflexPy
=======================================

**SuperflexPy** is an open source framework for building conceptual
hydrological models. Thanks to its modular design, **SuperflexPy** allows you
to build personalized model solutions and to expand the built-in functionalities
in few lines of code.

While being entirely implemented in Python, **SuperflexPy** can also be used
for computational expensive tasks that require multiple model invocations (e.g.
automatic calibration) since the usage of `numpy arrays`_ and the just in time
compiler (jit) numba_ guarantees fast execution time.

.. _numba: https://numba.pydata.org/

The model has been developed by Marco Dal Molin (Eawag) with the supervision
and support of Dr. Fabrizio Fenicia (Eawag) and Prof. Dmitri Kavetsy
(University of Adelaide).

Giving credits
--------------

Thank you for using **SuperflexPy**! Reaching a large group of users is
fundamental for the success of **SuperflexPy**. For this reason, we ask you to
advertise and cite the framework whenever you present or publish something that
was done using it:

- If you are presenting a work at a conference, please add a slide
  acknowledging **SuperflexPy**. You can use this image. **TODO**

- If you write a paper using **SuperflexPy**, please cite us. A paper
  presenting the framework is currently being written. Come back to this page
  before publishing your work and you will, hopefully, find information on how
  to cite the paper.

Making **SuperflexPy** successful will be beneficial also for you: more users
means also more potential developers that can extend the framework, building
new functionalities that may be useful also for your work.

Contributing
------------

There are several ways in which you can contribute to **SuperflexPy**:

- Being a user and asking for new features or spotting bugs (link) **TODO**.

- Creating your own components (link) and sharing them with the community **TODO**.

- Expanding the framework (link) with new functionalities and sharing them with
  the community **TODO**.

- Sharing with us your case study and allowing us to include them in the
  documentation **TODO**
