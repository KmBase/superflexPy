Application: implementation of existing conceptual models
=========================================================

This page proposes the implementation of existing conceptual hydrological
models using SuperflexPy. The translation of a model in SuperflexPy requires the following steps:

1. Design of a structure that reflects the original model but satisfies the
   requirements of SuperflexPy (e.g. does not contain mutual interaction
   between elements, see :ref:`unit`);
2. Extension of the framework, coding the required elements (as explained in
   the page :ref:`build_element`)
3. Construction of the model structure using the elements implemented at point 2

.. _M4_example:

M4 from Kavetski and Fenicia, WRR, 2011
---------------------------------------

M4 is a simple conceptual model presented, as part of a model comparison study,
in the article

    Kavetski, D., and F. Fenicia (2011), **Elements of a flexible approach for**
    **conceptual hydrological modeling: 2. Applicationand experimental**
    **insights**, WaterResour.Res.,47, W11511, doi:10.1029/2011WR010748.

Design of the structure
.......................

The structure of M4 is quite simple and can be implemented directly in
SuperflexPy without the need of using connection elements. The figure shows, on
the left, the structure as shown in the paper and, on the right, the SuperflexPy
implementation.

   :align: center

The upstream element, the unsaturated reservoir (UR), is intended to represent
runoff generation processes (e.g. separation between evaporation and runoff) and
it is controlled by the differential equation

.. math::
   & \overline{S} = \frac{S_{\textrm{UR}}}{S_{\textrm{max}}} \\
   & \frac{\textrm{d}S_{\textrm{UR}}}{\textrm{d}t} = P -
   E_{\textrm{P}} \left( \frac{\overline{S} \left(1+m\right)}{\overline{S} + m} \right) -
   P \left(\overline{S}\right)^\beta \\

The downstream element, the fast reservoir (FR), is intended to represent runoff
propagation processes (e.g. routing) and it is controlled by the differential
equation

.. math::
   & \frac{\textrm{d}S_{\textrm{FR}}}{\textrm{d}t} = P - kS_{\textrm{FR}}^\alpha \\

:math:`S_{\textrm{UR}}` and :math:`S_{\textrm{FR}}` are the states of the
reservoirs, :math:`P` is the input flux, :math:`E_{\textrm{P}}` is the potential
evapotranspiration, and :math:`S_{\textrm{max}}`, :math:`m`, :math:`\beta`,
:math:`k`, :math:`\alpha` are parameters of the model.

Elements creation
.................

We now show the code used to implement the elements designed in the
previous section. Instruction on how to use the framework to build new
elements can be found in the page :ref:`build_element`.

Note that some elements have already been implemented (refer to the page
:ref:`elements_list`) and, therefore, the modeller does not need to
implement them, as shown in this section.

GR4J
----

GR4J is a conceptual hydrological model introduced in the article

    Perrin, C., Michel, C., and AndrÃ©assian, V.: **Improvement of a**
    **parsimonious model for streamflow simulation**, Journal of Hydrology,
    279, 275-289, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-1694(03)00225-7, 2003.

The solution adopted here follows the "continuous state-space representation"
presented in

    Santos, L., Thirel, G., and Perrin, C.: **Continuous state-space**
    **representation of a bucket-type rainfall-runoff model: a case study**
    **with the GR4 model using state-space GR4 (version 1.0)**, Geosci. Model
    Dev., 11, 1591-1605, 10.5194/gmd-11-1591-2018, 2018.

Design of the structure
.......................

The figure shows, on the left, the model structure as proposed in Perrin et
al., 2003 and, on the right, the adaptation to SuperflexPy

.. image:: pics/popular_models/gr4j.png
   :align: center

The potential evaporation and the precipitation are "filtered" by an
interception layer that sets the smallest of the two fluxes to zero and the
biggest to the difference between the two.

.. math::
   & \textrm{if } P > PE:  \\
   & \quad P_{\textrm{NET}} = P -PE \\
   & \quad E_{\textrm{NET}}=0 \\
   & \textrm{else}: \\
   & \quad P_{\textrm{NET}} = 0 \\
   & \quad E_{\textrm{NET}}=PE-P \\

This element is reproduced identically in the SuperflexPy implementation by the
"interception filter"

In the original implementation of GR4J, the precipitation is split between a
part :math:`P_{\textrm{s}}` that flows into the production store and the
remaining part :math:`P_{\textrm{b}}` that bypasses the reservoir.
:math:`P_{\textrm{s}}` and :math:`P_{\textrm{b}}` are both function of the state
of the reservoir

.. math::
   & P_{\textrm{s}}=P_{\textrm{NET}}\left(1-\left(\frac{S_{\textrm{UR}}}{x_1}\right)^{\alpha}\right) \\
   & P_{\textrm{s}}=P_{\textrm{NET}}\left(\frac{S_{\textrm{UR}}}{x_1}\right)^{\alpha} \\

When we implement this part of the model in SuperflexPy, these two fluxes
cannot be calculated before solving the reservoir. For this reason, in the
SuperflexPy implementation of GR4J, all precipitation (and not only
:math:`P_{\textrm{s}}`) flows into an element that incorporates the production
store; this element takes care of dividing the precipitation internally, while
solving the differential equation

.. math::
   & \frac{\textrm{d}S_{\textrm{UR}}}{\textrm{d}t} =  P_{\textrm{NET}}\left(1-\left(\frac{S_{\textrm{UR}}}{x_1}\right)^{\alpha}\right)
     - E_{\textrm{NET}}\left(2\frac{S_{\textrm{UR}}}{x_1}-\left(\frac{S_{\textrm{UR}}}{x_1}\right)^\alpha\right)-
     \frac{x_1^{1-\beta}}{(\beta-1)} \nu^{\beta-1}S_{\textrm{UR}}^\beta \\

where the first term is the precipitation :math:`P_s`, the second term is the
actual evaporation, and the third term represent the output of the reservoir,
called "percolation".

Once the reservoir is solved (i.e. the values of :math:`S_{\textrm{UR}}` that
solve the differential equation are found), the element outputs the sum of
percolation and bypassing precipitation :math:`P_b`

After this, the flux is divided between two lag functions (called "unit
hydrograph", abbreviated UH): 90% of the flux goes to UH1 while the 10% goes
to UH2. In this part of the structure there is a strict correspondence
between the elements of GR4J and their SuperflexPy implementation.

The output of UH1 represents the input of the routing store, a reservoir that
is controlled by the differential equation

.. math::
   & \frac{\textrm{d}S_{\textrm{RR}}}{\textrm{d}t}=Q_{\textrm{UH1}} -
   \frac{x_3^{1-\gamma}}{(\gamma-1)}S_{\textrm{RR}}^\gamma-
   \frac{x_2}{x_3^\omega}S_{\textrm{RR}}^\omega\\

where the second term is the output of the reservoir and the last is a
gain/loss term (called :math:`Q_{\textrm{RF}}`).

The gain/loss term :math:`Q_{\textrm{RF}}`, which is a function of the state
:math:`S_{\textrm{RR}}` of the reservoir, is subtracted also to the output of
UH2: in SuperflexPy, this operation cannot be done at the same time as the
solution of the routing store but it is done afterwards. For this reason, the
SuperflexPy implementation of GR4J has an additional element (called "flux
aggregator") that collects (through a junction element) the output of the
routing store, the gain/loss term, and the output of UH2 and computes the
outflow of the model using the equation

.. math::
   & Q = Q_{\textrm{RR}} + \max(0;Q_{\textrm{UH2}} - Q_{\textrm{RF}}) \\

HYMOD
-----

HYMOD is a conceptual hydrological model presented in the Ph.D. thesis

   Boyle, D. P. (2001). **Multicriteria calibration of hydrologic models**,
   The University of Arizona. `Link <http://hdl.handle.net/10150/290657>`_

The solution proposed here follows the model structure presented in

   Wagener, T., Boyle, D. P., Lees, M. J., Wheater, H. S., Gupta, H. V.,
   and Sorooshian, S.: **A framework for development and application of**
   **hydrological models**, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 5, 13â26,
   https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-5-13-2001, 2001.

Design of the structure
.......................

.. image:: pics/popular_models/hymod.png
   :align: center

HYMOD is comprises three groups of reservoirs intended to represent the upper
zone (soil dynamics), channel routing (surface runoff), and lower zone
(subsurface flow).

As can be seen in the figure, the original structure of HYMOD already
satisfies the design constrains of SuperflexPy (it does not contains feedbacks
between elements). Therefore, unlike GR4J, HYMOD can be implemented in
SuperflexPy without the need for workarounds.

The first element (upper zone) is a reservoir intended to represent streamflow
generation processes and evaporation. It is controlled by the differential
equation

.. math::
   & \overline{S} = \frac{S_{\textrm{UR}}}{S_{\textrm{max}}} \\
   & \frac{\textrm{d}S_{\textrm{UR}}}{\textrm{d}t} = P - E -
   P \left(1 - \left(1-\overline{S}\right)^\beta\right) \\

where the first term represents the precipitation input, the second term is the
actual evaporation (which is equal to the potential evaporation as long as
there is sufficient storage in the reservoir), and the third term is the outflow
from the reservoir.

The outflow from the reservoir is then split between the channel routing and the
lower zone; these elements are all represented by linear reservoirs controlled
by the differential equation

.. math::
   & \frac{\textrm{d}S}{\textrm{d}t} = P - kS \\

where the first term is the input (here, the outflow from the upstream element)
and the second term represents the outflow from the reservoir.

Channel routing and lower zone differentiate one from the other by the number of
reservoirs used (3 in the first case and 1 in the second) and by the value of
:math:`k`, which controls the outflow rate. :math:`k` should have a larger value
for channel routing since it is design to represent faster processes.

The output of these two flowpaths are collected by a junction, which generates
the final model output.

Comparing the two panels in the figure, the only difference is the presence of
the two transparent element that are needed to fill the gaps that, otherwise,
will be present in the structure (see :ref:`unit`).

Elements creation
.................

We now show the code used to implement the elements designed in the
previous section. Instruction on how to use the framework to build new
elements can be found in the page :ref:`build_element`.

Note that some elements have already been implemented (refer to the page
:ref:`elements_list`) and, therefore, the modeller does not need to
implement them, as shown in this section.

Upper zone
**********

The code used to simulate the upper zone present a change in the equation used
to calculate the actual evaporation. In the original version (Wagener et al.,
2001) the equation is "described" in the text

   *The actual evapotranspiration is equal to the potential value if*
   *sufficient soil moisture is available; otherwise it is equal to the*
   *available soil moisture content.*

which translates to the equation

.. math::
   & \textrm{if } S > 0:  \\
   & \quad E = PE \\
   & \textrm{else}: \\
   & \quad E=0 \\

Unfortunately this solution is not smooth and can cause some computational
problems. A smooth version of this equation is given next

.. math::
   & \overline{S} = \frac{S_{\textrm{UR}}}{S_{\textrm{max}}} \\
   & E=PE\left( \frac{\overline{S}(1+\theta)}{\overline{S}+\theta} \right)\\

The upper zone reservoir can be implemented by extending the class
:code:`ODEsElement`.
